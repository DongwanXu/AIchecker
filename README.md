In this project, we will play the game of Checkers, the classic strategy board game. It is a version
of the game draughts and is also called American checkers or straight checkers. It uses an 8x8
checkered gameboard. Each player starts with 12 game pieces placed on the dark squares of
the side of the gameboard closest to them, as can be seen in the figure above. The side with the
darker colored pieces is usually called ‘Black’ and the side with the lighter color is ‘White’. Black
opens the game. The pieces move diagonally forward and can capture opponent’s pieces by
jumping over them. Whenever a piece reaches the opposite side of the board, it is crowned
king and gains the ability to move/capture both forward and backward. The game ends when
one side wins or a draw condition applies.
